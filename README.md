# 3F7 Lab code


This script contains code for a lab for a module 3F7 involving compression using Shannon-Fano coding, Huffman coding, and arithmetic coding.

The lab is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these three coding techniques and how they are implemented.

The main code is in `3F7lab.ipynb` and coding algorithm is implemented in `vl_codes.py`.
